# Deep Sea Fishing Event Tracker

This event tracker is an alt1 toolkit app for the Deep Sea Fishing Hub in RuneScape. The primary use is to send all event calls from a game client to the official [Deep Sea Fishing Discord Server](https://discord.gg/whirlpooldnd) where they can reach a wider audience.

## How to use

As long as the alt1 app is open (can be minimized), events from Misty will be captured and relayed to the [Deep Sea Fishing](https://discord.gg/whirlpooldnd) Discord.

## Requirements

- **Game Messages** must be set to either Filtered or ON.
- Please make sure the chatbox is clear of anything like buff bars overlapping.pp
